# GUI Measurement Converter
A simple modular measurement converter, built in Java using javafx.
This converter uses a modular system to load different measurements from XML files allowing new conversions to be quickly made.

This project was orignally created as part of my Foundation Degree in computing, after Uni I have decided to continue this project and develop it further.
