# GUI Measurement Converter
A simple modular measurement converter, built in Java using javafx.
This converter uses a modular system to load different measurements from XML files allowing new conversions to be quickly made.

This project was originally created as part of my foundation dDegree in computing, after university I have decided to continue this project and develop it further.
